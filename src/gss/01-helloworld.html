        SECTION1: But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born 
        and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of 
        the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because 
        it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that 
        are extremely painful.
    </section>

    <section id='section2'>    
        SECTION2: On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and 
        demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain 
        and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness 
        of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
